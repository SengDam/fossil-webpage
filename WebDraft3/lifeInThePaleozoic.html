    <div class="Overview">
        <p>The Paleozoic era spans almost two-hundred million years and contains seven periods. 
        Beginning six-hundred million years ago it has seen the Cambrian Explosion, 
        which was the rapid evolution of animals from seemingly nothing, 
        to the largest mass extinction at the end of the Permian.
         <a href = https://ucmp.berkeley.edu/paleozoic/paleozoicstrat.html target='_blank'>UCMP Berkeley</a> has a great timeline with some major events from each period listed.
          They also have some great information about why the periods are named the way they are. </p>
            
        <p>There are so many periods between the eras and if you’re like me it can be hard to remember them all, especially if you’re new to geology. 
            A fun way is to create your own mnemonics to help memorize everything!
            The Paleozoic era has seven (or eight if you split the Carboniferous). 
            For me it’s just enough to forget during a big test. 
            A good one for the Paleozoic is “Conan O’Brian Sees Down My Pants Pockets”!
             Standing for the Cambrian, Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian, Mississippian, Pennsylvanian and Permian periods!</p>

    <div id="LeftColumn" class="LeftColumn" >
        <div id="infoCambrianLeft" class= ' infoDescription hidden'>
            <p>The Cambrian period is named for Wales, with Cambria being the Latin word for Wales. This is because the Cambrian rocks were first studied in Wales. 
                Cambrian rocks are where fossils are first found to be widespread. 
                All the fossils found in this layer of rocks come from the sea. Common fossils found in the lower Cambrian are algae, arthropods, brachiopods, mollusks and echinoderms.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="infoOrdovicianLeft" class= ' infoDescription hidden'>
            <p>The period following the Cambrian was the Ordovician. The Ordovician period was named for the Celtic tribe, the Ordovices. 
                In the Ordovician we find the oldest vertebrae, not much is known about the animals they belong to. 
                This period introduces us to many new forms of life like echinoids, graptolites and bryozoans.</p>
                    <p>The different environments of the Ordovician allowed for different areas to have different species prosper. 
                        Shallow water lime and mud stones are the most common sources of fossils from this time. </p>
        </div>
        <div id="infoSilurianLeft" class= ' infoDescription hidden'>
            <p>In keeping with the periods before it the Silurian period was named for the Silures, an ancient welsh tribe. 
                Rather than animals, plant life was the dominated the period. Fossils from the oldest plants, psilopsids, can be found in this layer. Ancient reefs can be found in the Silurian limestones near Chicago. 
                These reefs are the source of many great fossils like algae, brachiopods and crinoids.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="infoDevonianLeft" class= ' infoDescription hidden'>
            <p>The Devonian period was named for Devon, England. This is where the rocks of the period were first studied. Also called the age of fish, the Devonian saw many new types. There were ostracoderms, which were jawless fish, placoderms, fish with plate-skin, Osteichthyes, the first sharks and boney fishes. 
                There weren’t just fish in the Devonian, it also saw the first insects, spiders and millipedes. By the end of the Devonian forests and ferns were widespread. </p>
        </div>
        <div id="infoCarboniferousLeft" class= ' infoDescription hidden'>
            <p>The Carboniferous period is named for the rich coal deposits found in the rocks relating to this period. During the Carboniferous terrestrial life became well established. 
                Amphibians were the dominant land species of the period but there were also large arthropods roaming the swampy forests that would eventually turn into the coal the period is known for.</p>
                <p>The Carboniferous period is treated as two periods in North America. Those are the Mississippian and Pennsylvanian periods. 
                    This was done to separate the layers containing coal, the Pennsylvanian and the layers made up of mostly limestone, the Mississippian.</p>
                <h3>Pennsylvanian</h3>
                <h4>318.1 mya - 299.0 mya</h4>
                <p>The Pennsylvanian was named for the coal-baring strata of Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvanian landscape was filled with great swamps and deltas surrounded and sometimes covered by shallow seas. The common plants of this period were lycopods, pteridosperms and horsetails. There also lived giant dragonflies with a 30-inch wingspan and many amphibians. The Pennsylvanian saw the emergence of reptiles. </p>
                <h3>Mississippian</h3>
                <h4>359.2 mya - 318.1 mya</h4>
                <p>The Mississippian is named for the limestone found by the Mississippi river. This period is characterized by warm shallow seas. Most of the rock from this period are fossilized sea life such as corals, brachiopods and bryozoans.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="infoPermianLeft" class= ' infoDescription hidden'>
            <p>The Permian era was named for the region of Perm in Russia. This was the last period of the Paleozoic era and ended with a mass extinction. 
                During this period many new insects emerged. Streams and ponds were home to many new fish species and amphibians flourished. 
                Reptiles also gained a footing at this time with a few sail-backed lizards like Dimetrodon and Edaphosaurus. 
                By the end of the Permian most of the life that dominated the Paleozoic had become extinct.</p>
